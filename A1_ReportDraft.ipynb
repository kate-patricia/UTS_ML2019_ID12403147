        "In 1999, the NNS Problem was decades old and had been referred to by many names, such as the Best Match Problem (Minsky-Papert 1969) and the Post Office Problem (Knuth 1973). In 1999, the authors considered the low-dimensional case of the NNS Problem to have been solved. However, they considered the NNS case when dealing with high dimensions to be a main issue with decades of unsatisfactory solutions. The authors refer in the title of their paper to the 'Curse of Dimensionality' - coined by Richard E. Bellman in 1957. The Curse of Dimensionality refers to the problems faced when working in high-dimensional space. For NNS with large d, the existing [FINISH THIS SENTENCE PLS]\n",
        "\n",
        "To seek solutions to the NNS Problem, researchers began to relax the problem by introducing some approximation factor. This offshoot is called the 'Approximate Nearest Neighbor' Problem (ANN, not to be confused with 'Artifical Neural Networks'). By introducing approximation, this reduces the complexity of the problem. Indyk and Motwani argue that insisting on an absolute nearest neighbor is overkill and, for most practical purposes, an approximate nearest neighbor is sufficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "There were two main waves of algorithms which attempted to solve the ANN Problem. The first wave occured in the early 90s and the algorithms are described by Indyk (2018) as being 'exponential in d'. The second wave, in which the paper that is the topic of this report falls, was characterised by algorithms that were 'polynomial in d'.\n"
