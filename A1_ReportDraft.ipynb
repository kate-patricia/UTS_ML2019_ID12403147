        "In 1999, the NNS Problem was decades old and had been referred to by many names, such as the Best Match Problem (Minsky-Papert 1969) and the Post Office Problem (Knuth 1973). In 1999, the authors considered the low-dimensional case of the NNS Problem to have been solved. However, they considered the NNS case when dealing with high dimensions to be a main issue with decades of unsatisfactory solutions. The authors refer in the title of their paper to the 'Curse of Dimensionality' - the problems faced when working in high-dimensional space.\n",

        "To seek solutions to the NNS Problem, researchers began to relax the problem by introducing some approximation factor. This offshoot is called the 'Approximate Nearest Neighbor' Problem (ANN, not to be confused with 'Artifical Neural Networks'). By introducing approximation, this reduces the complexity of the problem. Indyk and Motwani argue that insisting on an absolute nearest neighbor is overkill and, for most practical purposes, an approximate nearest neighbor is sufficient.\n",
